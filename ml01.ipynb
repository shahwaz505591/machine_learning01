    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning can be used in anomaly detection by modeling the normal behavior of a system or dataset and identifying data points that deviate significantly from that model. One common technique is clustering, where normal data points cluster together, and anomalies stand out as separate clusters or data points far from any cluster.\n",
